# Privacy Policy

## Introduction

The Kayak Freestyle App (“the App”) is designed to provide an exceptional kayaking experience without requiring any personal data from its users. We value user privacy above all, ensuring that no identifying information is collected. This privacy policy outlines how we handle data and use third-party services solely for improvement purposes.

---

## Data Collection

The App does not collect personal, identifiable, or usage data directly from users. There are no registrations, user accounts, or profile information stored. You can use the App completely anonymously without any data being recorded by us.

---

## Third-Party Services

To build and host the App, we rely on Expo, a third-party platform providing tools and analytics. Expo collects only anonymized metrics related to app performance, usage patterns, and crash reports. These metrics are aggregated and cannot be linked back to any individual user.

---

## Use of Anonymized Metrics

The anonymized metrics collected by Expo help us identify issues, optimize performance, and understand feature usage trends. This data is used solely to enhance the App's stability and user experience. We do not access or retain individual-level analytics data.

---

## Data Sharing and Security

Since the App collects no personal data, we do not share any user information with external parties. Expo's anonymized metrics are managed under their own privacy policy, which you can review here: https://expo.dev/privacy. We implement industry-standard security measures to protect any necessary system and operational data.

---

## Children’s Privacy
We do not knowingly collect any information from users in this age group. If you believe your child has provided personal data within the App, please contact us to request deletion.

---

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this privacy policy periodically to reflect changes in practices or regulatory requirements. Any significant updates will be communicated via the App with the revised effective date. Continued use of the App after changes indicates acceptance of the new policy.
